PyExpose generates a Python extension described by a specification file. It
strives to allow exposing C++ classes and functions to Python without any
overhead compared to writing the extension manually.


Dependencies:
Jinja2 (http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/)
GCCXML (http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html)


Basic Usage:
pyexpose spec-file
or on Windows: python pyexpose spec-file 

A C++ source and header file will be generated with the name of the extension module.

The generated code will depend on pyexpose_common.h, included with the PyExpose
installation. If you wish to distribute the generated code, you are free to copy
pyexpose_common.h (and optionally pyobject.h--not yet documented) into your
project and distribute it together. Define LOCAL_PYEXPOSE_COMMON to have the
generated code include "pyexpose_common.h" instead of
<PyExpose/pyexpose_common.h>.

The specification file is an XML file that specifies the interface to expose to
python. For documentation see
